# CBT Agent v1 - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Assistant Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Create a professional CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) therapist agent that provides structured, evidence-based therapeutic sessions
• Transform AI agents into specialized therapeutic tools with proper clinical boundaries and protocols
• Enable users to access structured CBT interventions through conversational AI while maintaining therapeutic integrity
• Build a system that maintains client continuity, progress tracking, and therapeutic relationship management
• Establish a privacy-first architecture that processes therapeutic data securely with complete client isolation
• Pioneer AI-powered therapeutic assistance that complements (not replaces) professional mental health care
• Create a foundation for specialized therapeutic agents across different therapeutic modalities
• Validate therapeutic AI agent architecture through structured CBT implementation

### Background Context

Traditional AI agents lack the specialized training, structure, and continuity required for therapeutic applications. While AI assistants can provide general support, they cannot deliver the structured, evidence-based interventions that characterize professional therapy. The growing demand for accessible mental health support, combined with advances in AI capabilities, creates an opportunity to develop specialized therapeutic agents that can provide structured CBT sessions while maintaining appropriate clinical boundaries.

The CBT Agent v1 addresses this gap by implementing a professional CBT therapist persona ("Dr. Sarah") with structured session management, client profile tracking, therapeutic technique integration, and evidence-based intervention protocols. Unlike general AI assistants, this system maintains therapeutic continuity, tracks client progress, and delivers structured CBT sessions while clearly establishing its role as a therapeutic tool rather than a replacement for professional mental health care.

9. Goal mapping updates automatically when user discusses existing goals or mentions new ones
10. User can visualize their goal hierarchy with `/goals` command showing relationships, conflicts, and multi-parent connections
11. AI identifies motivation-based conflicts: autonomous goals rarely conflict vs controlled goals create internal tension and competing pressures
12. System recognizes when lower-level concrete goals serve higher-level values and suggests alternative actions: "Both X and Y serve your value of family connection - what other ways could you achieve that?"
13. AI facilitates motivation exploration using SDT insights: "What makes this goal meaningful to you?" (autonomous) vs "What pressure do you feel around this?" (controlled)
14. Conflict resolution addresses higher-level values rather than just managing competing actions: "These goals compete at the action level, but both serve your identity as a caring parent"
15. System identifies when controlled goals conflict with autonomous goals and helps user explore the underlying tensions

## Epic 4: Advanced Memory Integration & Intelligence

I want the AI to handle situations where my current statements contradict my previous insights gracefully,
so that my memory stays accurate while respecting my evolving thoughts and circumstances.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. System detects when users contradict any stored information across all memory files (User Profile, Agent Relationship, Session Summaries)
2. AI acknowledges the previous information and seeks explicit confirmation before updating: "You've mentioned X before, but this sounds different. Has that changed for you?"
3. For permanent preferences, AI asks for explicit confirmation of change rather than assuming the update: "You previously said you never want to discuss Y. Has that shifted?"
4. System distinguishes between temporary contradictions (mood-based, situational) and genuine changes in perspective or circumstances
5. When contradictions are resolved, AI updates all relevant files with new information and marks previous information as evolved/changed
6. Contradiction resolution includes evidence trail showing what changed when and why
7. AI helps user explore what caused the change if they're interested: "What helped you see this differently?"
8. System maintains history of contradictions and resolutions to track user growth and evolution

### Story 4.3: Advanced Pattern Analysis and Cross-Domain Connections
As a user,
I want the AI to identify sophisticated patterns that connect different areas of my life,
so that I can understand deeper themes and make connections I wouldn't see on my own.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. System analyzes patterns across different life domains (work, relationships, health, goals) to identify meta-patterns and cross-domain connections
2. AI identifies when similar emotional or behavioral patterns appear in different contexts: "You mentioned avoiding difficult conversations with both your boss and your partner"
3. System connects patterns to goal conflicts and revelations to show comprehensive picture: "Your procrastination pattern seems to emerge when goals feel overwhelming"
4. AI surfaces pattern evolution over time: "Three months ago decisions took you weeks, but lately you're deciding quickly - what's changed?"
5. System identifies pattern triggers and successful intervention strategies based on user's history
6. AI suggests pattern-based insights for user validation: "I notice you're most creative after resolving conflicts - does that ring true?"
7. Cross-domain analysis respects user boundaries and doesn't force connections user isn't ready to explore
8. User can request pattern analysis with `/patterns` command to see comprehensive pattern overview

### Story 4.4: Predictive Insights and Proactive Support
As a user,
I want the AI to anticipate patterns and offer proactive support based on my history,
so that I can prepare for challenges and leverage my successful strategies before problems arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. System analyzes historical patterns to predict likely upcoming challenges based on user's recurring cycles and triggers
2. AI offers proactive support when patterns suggest difficulty ahead: "You mentioned that big presentation Thursday. Your pattern shows anxiety building beforehand - want to plan for that?"
3. System suggests previously successful intervention strategies when similar situations arise: "Last time this happened, the 10-minute walk really helped"
4. AI identifies optimal timing for certain conversations or interventions based on user's emotional and energy patterns
5. System recognizes positive pattern trends and acknowledges growth: "You've been handling conflict much more directly lately - that's real progress"
6. Predictive insights are offered gently as suggestions, never as determinations: "This might be one of those situations where..." 
7. User can disable predictive features or adjust sensitivity in Agent Relationship preferences
8. AI learns from prediction accuracy and adjusts future predictions based on what actually happens vs. what was predicted

### Top Issues by Priority

#### BLOCKERS: None - PRD is development-ready

#### HIGH Priority:
- **Performance validation** (NFR6-8): 10-second async update limits need technical validation
- **MVP scope complexity**: Psychological frameworks significantly increase development effort

#### MEDIUM Priority:
- **User research validation**: Problem statement based on assumptions rather than user interviews
- **Technical risk assessment**: Continuous session updates may require architectural investigation

#### LOW Priority:
- **Competitive analysis**: Could strengthen market positioning
- **User feedback mechanisms**: Not critical for MVP but valuable for iteration

### MVP Scope Assessment

#### Features for Phase 2 Consideration:
- **Story 2.5**: Psychological Goal Framework Implementation (Epic 2)
- **Enhanced Story 3.4**: Complex goal conflict psychology (5 additional ACs)
- **Story 4.3**: Cross-domain pattern analysis
- **Story 4.4**: Predictive insights

#### Core MVP Features (Retain):
- **Epic 1**: Foundation & conversation engine (essential)
- **Epic 2**: Basic memory system (Stories 2.1-2.4)
- **Epic 3**: Basic discovery facilitation (Stories 3.1-3.3, simplified 3.4)
- **Epic 4**: Basic memory integration (Stories 4.1-4.2)

#### Complexity Concerns:
- **Psychological framework integration**: Requires specialized knowledge base development
- **Real-time session updates**: Performance and reliability challenges
- **Cross-file memory management**: Complex data consistency requirements

#### Timeline Assessment:
- **Current scope**: 8-12 months for full implementation
- **Simplified MVP**: 4-6 months without psychological frameworks
- **Phased approach**: 4-6 months MVP + 3-4 months Phase 2

### Technical Readiness

#### Strengths:
- **Clear architecture**: BMAD-inspired standalone system well-defined
- **File-based approach**: Appropriate for MVP scale and user isolation
- **Technology choices**: Python + Claude API + CLI approach is straightforward

#### Technical Risks Requiring Investigation:
- **Continuous session updates**: Can async processing + file I/O reliably stay under 10 seconds?
- **Claude API performance**: Will conversation analysis consistently meet response time requirements?
- **Memory consistency**: How to handle concurrent file updates and race conditions?

#### Areas Needing Architect Input:
- **Session update architecture**: Background processing implementation strategy
- **File locking mechanisms**: Prevent corruption during concurrent updates
- **Error recovery**: Graceful degradation when AI processing fails

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Consider MVP scope reduction**: Defer psychological frameworks to Phase 2 for faster validation
2. **Technical proof of concept**: Validate 10-second session update constraints before full development
3. **User research validation**: Conduct 5-10 interviews with target users to validate problem assumptions

#### Development Strategy:
1. **Start with Epic 1**: Build solid foundation before complexity
2. **Prototype session updates**: Test performance constraints early
3. **Incremental psychological features**: Add SDT/hierarchy analysis gradually in Phase 2

#### Technical Investigation Priorities:
1. **Session update performance**: Can real-time processing meet constraints?
2. **File concurrency handling**: How to prevent data corruption?
3. **AI reliability**: Fallback strategies when Claude API fails or takes too long?

### Final Decision

**NEARLY READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD is comprehensive and well-structured with clear requirements and epic breakdown. Minor refinements needed:

1. **Validate technical constraints** for session updates (performance flags)
2. **Consider scope reduction** for faster MVP validation
3. **Technical risk assessment** for continuous processing architecture

The documentation quality is excellent and provides sufficient detail for architectural design to begin while these technical validations occur in parallel.
