## Complete Command System

All commands require `*` prefix:

### Core Commands
- **help**: Show numbered list of available commands
- **profile**: Show current understanding of user (loads user-profile.md)
- **update-profile**: Update user profile based on current conversation
- **reflect**: Reflect on conversation and key insights
- **remember**: Store important new information about user

### Method Loading Commands
- **advice**: Provide specific advice (loads advice-methods.md when triggered)
- **challenge**: Challenge limiting beliefs and assumptions (loads belief-challenging-methods.md when triggered)
- **expertise**: Access specialized knowledge (loads relevant expertise files)

### Memory Management Commands
- **save**: Execute end-of-conversation protocol - update all memory files
- **s**: Execute save protocol then reload agent with updated memories
- **exit**: Execute save protocol, then say goodbye and abandon persona

## Key Design Decisions & Reasoning

### 1. Pure Markdown Architecture
**Decision**: Use only markdown files, no code dependencies  
**Reasoning**: 
- Niv's preference for simple, portable systems
- Easy version control and human readability
- No technical dependencies or setup requirements
- Matches successful CBT-agent pattern

### 2. Explicit vs Inferential Instructions
**Decision**: Bulletproof, step-by-step instructions rather than inferential language  
**Reasoning**: 
- Aug 16 discovery: "agent needs to be told exactly what to do"
- Previous issues with vague instructions like "Remember everything about the user"
- Niv's preference for explicit, actionable protocols

### 3. Friend vs Professional Consultant Approach
**Decision**: Natural friendship dynamic over formal consultant presentation  
**Reasoning**: 
- Aug 16 insight: "people will be happier to have a companion vs therapeutic help"
- User preference for "down-to-earth, non-bombastic" interaction
- Better business model than therapeutic approach

### 4. Resource Loading Strategy
**Decision**: Awareness vs Loading - know what's available but only load when triggered  
**Reasoning**: 
- Context efficiency - avoid loading unused methods
- Session tracking prevents redundant loading
- Clear distinction between knowing resources exist vs having them active

### 5. Live Memory Documentation
**Decision**: Update memory files during conversation, not just at end  
**Reasoning**: 
- Applied successful CBT-agent pattern
- Prevents loss of insights if conversation ends unexpectedly
- Real-time learning and adaptation

### 6. Pattern Monitoring System
**Decision**: Proactive pattern detection and challenging  
**Reasoning**: 
- Aug 17 user request: "detect decision-making trouble, fears, limiting beliefs"
- Real-time support more valuable than post-conversation analysis
- Helps overcome obstacles as they arise

### 7. Documentation Sync Protocol
**Decision**: Maintain both instruction and documentation files  
**Reasoning**: 
- Instructions (.claude/commands/) for LLM operation
- Documentation (agents/) for user understanding
- Different purposes require different formats

## Resource Loading Protocols

### Activation Loading (Automatic)
1. **user-profile.md** - Step 3 of activation
2. **user-preferences.md** - Step 4 of activation  
3. **thinking-patterns.md** - Step 5 of activation

### Command-Triggered Loading
- `*advice` → loads advice-methods.md
- `*challenge` → loads belief-challenging-methods.md
- `*goals` → loads goals-tracker.md
- `*profile` → loads user-profile.md (if not already loaded)

### Auto-Loading Triggers
- **Agent development tasks** → loads AgentsCreator.md
- **Agent enhancement tasks** → loads AgentEnhancement.md
- **Limiting beliefs detected** → loads belief-challenging-methods.md
- **Guidance requested** → loads advice-methods.md

### Session Tracking
- Each resource loaded only once per session
- Prevents context bloat from redundant loading
- Clear tracking of what's currently available vs loaded

## Memory Update Protocols

### Live Memory Protocol
**When**: Throughout conversation  
**Triggers**: 
- User shares important personal information
- User makes decisions about goals/projects
- User reveals new patterns or insights
- Major breakthroughs or "aha" moments occur
- User's situation or priorities change

**File**: conversation-history.md  
**Format**:
```markdown
### [Date] - [Ongoing Topic]
- **Key insight**: [specific insight gained]
- **Decision made**: [any decisions user made]
- **Preference noted**: [communication preferences]
- **Quote**: "[meaningful user statement]"
- **Pattern observed**: [behavioral patterns]
```

### Pattern Documentation Protocol *(Added Aug 17)*
**When**: Real-time during conversation  
**Triggers**: 
- Competition assumptions detected
- Limiting beliefs expressed
- Decision paralysis observed
- Perfectionism patterns spotted

**File**: patterns-observed.md  
**Format**: Date, quote, context, and pattern type

### End-of-Conversation Protocol
**When**: Conversation naturally concludes or `*save` command used  
**Files Updated**:
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: conversation-history.md (always)
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: user-profile.md (if significant changes)
- **LOW PRIORITY**: Other files (if relevant content emerged)

## Quality Standards & Testing

### Enhancement Protocol (Added Aug 17)
Any new abilities must follow 5-phase protocol:
1. **Analysis & Planning** - Gap identification and impact assessment
2. **Implementation Plan** - File updates and implementation order
3. **Systematic Implementation** - Update activation, dependencies, commands, documentation
4. **Quality Assurance** - File verification, functionality testing, content quality
5. **Testing & Validation** - Reload testing, ability testing, user validation

### File Synchronization Requirements
- Main command file changes must sync to documentation file
- Core concepts aligned between instruction and documentation versions
