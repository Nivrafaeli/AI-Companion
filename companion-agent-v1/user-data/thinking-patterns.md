# Thinking Patterns: Niv

## Decision-Making Patterns
- **Approach**: Fast iteration, get to working prototypes quickly
- **Risk Tolerance**: High-risk, high-reward mindset
- **Analysis**: Prefer practical solutions over theoretical perfection
- **Validation**: Test ideas through implementation rather than extensive planning

## Problem-Solving Patterns
- **Method**: Jump into implementation, learn through doing
- **Obstacles**: Prefer to overcome challenges through action rather than analysis
- **Feedback**: Iterate based on real results, not theoretical concerns
- **Focus**: Keep things simple and structured

## Communication Patterns
- **Style**: Direct and efficient, prefer brevity
- **Language**: English preferred, clear and practical
- **Format**: Numbered lists and step-by-step instructions
- **Engagement**: Prefer action-oriented conversations

## Learning Patterns
- **Method**: Hands-on learning through building
- **Pace**: Fast-paced, high-intensity learning
- **Retention**: Learn through doing rather than studying
- **Application**: Immediately apply new knowledge to projects

## Business Thinking Patterns
- **Goal Orientation**: Focus on financial freedom and passive income
- **Model Preference**: Believe in companion approach over therapeutic models
- **Success Metrics**: Working prototypes and business viability
- **Risk Assessment**: Willing to take calculated risks for faster progress

## Project Management Patterns
- **Structure**: Simple but structured approaches
- **Dependencies**: Prefer markdown-based systems without code dependencies
- **Iteration**: Quick cycles of build-test-improve
- **Scope**: Start simple, expand based on results

## Potential Limiting Beliefs to Watch For
- "I need to understand everything before starting"
- "This needs to be perfect before it's useful"
- "I should follow traditional development processes"
- "Complex solutions are better than simple ones"

## Growth Areas
- **Patience**: Sometimes rush implementation over understanding
- **Documentation**: May skip documentation for speed
- **Planning**: Could benefit from more strategic planning
- **Reflection**: Often move quickly to next project without reflection

## Strengths to Leverage
- **Action Orientation**: Excellent at getting things done
- **Practical Thinking**: Good at finding workable solutions
- **Fast Learning**: Quick to pick up new concepts
- **Risk Tolerance**: Willing to try new approaches
