- Need immediate anxiety relief technique
- Beginning stages of relaxation training

### Brief Description for Patient
"Let's learn a technique to help your body relax by tensing and then releasing different muscle groups."

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Assess Initial Tension and Explain
**Ask:** "On a scale of 1-10, how tense does your body feel right now?"
**Note:** Initial tension level
**Then explain:** "This technique helps you notice the difference between tension and relaxation in your body. We'll tense muscle groups for 5 seconds, then release and notice the relaxed feeling."
**Check understanding:** "Does this make sense? Any questions before we start?"

#### Step 2: Set Up Environment
**Guide patient:** "Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes if that feels comfortable."
**Ensure:** Quiet environment, no distractions

#### Step 3: Start with Hands and Arms
**Instruct:** "Make fists with both hands and tense your arms. Hold for 5 seconds... now release and let your arms go completely limp."
**Guide attention:** "Notice the difference between the tension and the relaxation."

#### Step 4: Progress Through Muscle Groups
**Continue systematically through:**
- Face and head (scrunch face, then release)
- Shoulders and neck (pull shoulders to ears, then drop)
- Chest and back (arch back slightly, then release)
- Stomach (tighten stomach muscles, then release)
- Legs and feet (tense legs and point toes, then release)

#### Step 5: Full Body Relaxation
**Final step:** "Now tense your whole body for 5 seconds... and release everything. Just breathe naturally and notice how your body feels."
**Allow:** 2-3 minutes of quiet relaxation

#### Step 6: Check Final State and Gradual Return
**Guide back:** "When you're ready, slowly open your eyes."
**Ask:** "How does your body feel now on that same 1-10 scale? What did you notice during the exercise?"
**Note:** Final tension level and patient observations
**Follow up:** "What was most helpful about this technique for you?"

### Natural Completion Signals
- Patient reports feeling more relaxed
- Visible reduction in physical tension

**Ask:** "On a scale of 1-10, how anxious or overwhelmed are you feeling right now?"

#### Step 4: Count Breaths (Optional)
**If helpful:** "If it helps you focus, you can count breaths from 1 to 10, then start over at 1."
**Emphasize:** "If you lose count, just start again at 1. No problem."

#### Step 5: Handle Mind Wandering
**When mind wanders:** "Notice where your mind went - thoughts, sounds, feelings - then gently guide attention back to breathing."
**Reassure:** "This is the practice - noticing and returning. You're doing it right."

#### Step 6: Check Final State and Gradual Ending
**After 5-10 minutes:** "Take a few more conscious breaths, then slowly open your eyes."
**Ask:** "How do you feel now on that same 1-10 scale? What did you notice during the breathing exercise?"
**Note:** Final anxiety level, duration, and patient insights
**Follow up:** "How often did you notice your mind wandering? That's completely normal."
