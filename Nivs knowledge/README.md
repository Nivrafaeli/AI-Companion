## Purpose
These files provided the foundation for understanding the psychology frameworks and methods that were incorporated into the new pure-markdown system with separated knowledge and methods structure.

## New System Location
The restructured system is now in the main project directory with:
- `data/knowledge/`: Theoretical psychology information
- `data/methods/`: Practical facilitation techniques
- Clear separation between context and actionable workflows
