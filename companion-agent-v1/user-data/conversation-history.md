# Conversation History

## Recent Conversations

### Aug 16, 2025 - Fixing Companion Agent Activation & Memory System
- **Main Issue**: Agent wasn't reading user profile on activation, had to be asked "what do you know about me?" first
- **Root Problem**: Activation instructions were vague ("Remember everything about the user") instead of explicit file-reading commands
- **Solution Created**: 
  - Updated activation instructions to explicitly read `companion-agent-v1/user-data/user-profile.md` 
  - Created `user-preferences.md` with greeting rules (don't recite everything, pick up conversation naturally)
  - Updated agent to load both profile AND preferences files on activation
- **Key Insight**: Agent needs bulletproof, step-by-step instructions - can't rely on inference
- **Niv's Feedback**: Don't dump entire history when greeting, be natural like a real friend

### Aug 16, 2025 - Building Memory System (Continued)
- **Memory Challenge**: Agent needed to remember conversations but wasn't saving automatically
- **Niv's Solution**: Apply CBT-agent pattern - tell agent to note things during conversation and save at end
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added LIVE MEMORY PROTOCOL: Document insights during conversation in conversation-history.md
  - Added END-OF-CONVERSATION PROTOCOL: Update all memory files when conversation ends
  - Created `*save` command to trigger end-of-conversation protocol
  - Created `*s` command to save and reload agent with updated memories
- **Key Decision**: Save memories to files during conversation, not just at the end
- **Pattern Learned**: Need explicit commands and file destinations - agent can't infer when/where to save

### Aug 16, 2025 - Communication Preferences & Automatic Memory
- **Feedback**: "You are talking too much" - need shorter responses
- **Personal Info**: Non-native English speaker, has two kids (busy lifestyle)
- **Memory Question**: Can agent update files without asking permission?
- **Answer**: Yes - that's what live memory protocol is for, should be automatic and seamless
- **Updated**: user-preferences.md and user-profile.md with communication style
- **Question**: "Do you have good methods for giving advice?"
- **Discovery**: CBT-agent has structured methods - good patterns to adapt for companion advice
- **CBT Methods Analysis**: 25 methods across 5 files, no redundancies found
- **Next**: Create advice-methods.md with CBT-adapted + business/decision methods
- **Question**: Where to save advice-methods.md? Need to decide directory structure
- **Clarification**: Agent should know methods exist but not auto-load them - reference when needed for advice
- **Implementation Complete**: Created companion-methods/advice-methods.md with 6 structured methods
- **Agent Updated**: Added methods reference to dependencies and advice command
- **Question**: When to use YAML vs MD vs YAML-in-MD for best LLM readability?
- **Solution**: Created editable llm-instruction-rules-summary.md with all patterns from precise-llm-instructions.md
- **Filed**: Moved to Expertise/AgentsCreator.md
- **Agent Updated**: Added expertise system - agent now knows about AgentsCreator expertise area
- **Auto-Loading Protocol**: Agent will automatically use AgentsCreator expertise when user asks to create agent-related files
- **Clarification System**: Agent asks if unsure whether task needs expertise
- **Session Tracking**: Expertise loaded only once per session to avoid context bloat

### Aug 16, 2025 - Session Summary and Major Accomplishments
